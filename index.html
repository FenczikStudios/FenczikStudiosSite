            Guitarbacus.com is a guitar-learning application I am developing for web and mobile devices. The goal of 
            guitarbacus.com is to provide a unique way of learning guitar and music generally with an emphasis on improvisation and 
            creative expression. The main page of the site allows users to select any key and musical mode they like and 
            see the scale appear immediately on the guitarneck. For beginners, I have written guides inside the app to help introduce
            all the necessary information required to start making music like a pro!
            <br><br>
            The site is still under construction, however I would love to hear your thoughts!
            Feel free to spend some time with the guitarbacus, then send me a message <br> telling me all about your experience!

            <p class="active">This Shotgun wielding Hippo was created using Spine2d animation software. This character is 
                game ready with all of the basic game animations: Run, Jump, Shoot etc.</p>
            <p>Here is another character created using Spine2d. This character is still in development. The 
                idea for this character is to be game ready with the potential for different skins. He has his basic 
                animations however the skins are still in development.</p>
            <p>The Guitarbacus is an innovative new Guitar learning application 
                in development for web and mobile devices. The Guitarbacus acts as a skeleton key
                for the guitar and it's an idea that is very close to my heart.
                I have always dreamed of creating a simple tool that allows musicians to learn the guitar, music theory
                and improvisation in a new intuitive way. The Guitarbacus is designed to maximize creativity.
                And I truely believe it does just that!</p>
            <p>I am currently working on a puzzle platformer games in my spare time. You play as 
                Theo Jazzman, a horn player who was mysteriously magiced away to an abstract world of jazz and music.
                This character was created in photoshop and animated in Spine2d.</p>
            <p>Theo Jazzman's Quest, as I am currently calling it, is a game that does not hold your hand. 
                the player must explore and interact with the world in order to progress through the game and unravel 
                the mysteries of the Jazziverse!</p>

            <p class="active">Mindful Moose Gardening is an awesome new gardening business based in Colorado Springs. They are the 
                garden gurus and now they have an awesome logo to show off just how awesome they are!</p>
            <p>Smitty custom cues are custom made pool cues created from only the finest materials.</p>
            <p>Hero Sword is a toy created by Next Toys. I was tasked with creating an epic box design that inspires
                the inner hero of every kid.</p>
            <p>Next toys is a small toy manufacturing company located in Kowloon Bay, China. They tasked me 
                with creating a logo and brand identity for their company.
            </p>
            <p>Real Radical Flight is the brain-child of Jeffrey Loeb. His idea: create amazingly fun toys that teach 
                kids about aerodyamics. Real Radical Flight is NASA meets paper planes. Above is the design we decided upon.
             </p>
            <p>Unfortunately, KitCo Tires is not a real company. Instead, it is a tiny one-inch sticker designed as part of a set
                of sponsorship decals for an RC car called Redneck Roadkill by Eclipse Toys. This logo was my favorite out of 
                the bunch. You can find this and many other cool items created by yours truely inside the Redneck Roadkill box.  
            </p>
            <p>AC Supply is your one stop shop for all things model rocket related. AC supply was indesperate need of
                of striking new logo to show off how cool their business is. Thats where I came in. This new logo is iconic
                and conveys exactly what AC Supply is all about with just a glance.
            </p>
            <p>Debbie Dawson is an amazing hairstylist however, she lacked an eye-catching brand identity that matched 
                her skill. This logo above was our solution. Intended for business cards, letter head and the like. This logo 
                was also printed as a large vinyl sticker to be shown on the front window of her salon!
