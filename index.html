            Guitarbacus.com is a guitar-learning application I am developing for web and mobile devices. The goal of 
            guitarbacus.com is to provide a unique way of learning guitar and music generally with an emphasis on improvisation and 
            creative expression. The main page of the site allows users to select any key and musical mode they like and 
            see the scale appear immediately on the guitarneck. For beginners, I have written guides inside the app to help introduce
            all the necessary information required to start making music like a pro!
            <br><br>
            The site is still under construction, however I would love to hear your thoughts!
            Feel free to spend some time with the guitarbacus, then send me a message <br> telling me all about your experience!

            <p class="active">The Guitarbacus is an innovative new Guitar learning application 
                in development for web and mobile devices. The Guitarbacus acts as a skeleton key
                for the guitar and it's an idea that is very close to my heart.
                I have always dreamed of creating a simple tool that allows musicians to learn the guitar, music theory
                and improvisation in a new intuitive way. The Guitarbacus is designed to maximize creativity.
                And I truely believe it does just that!</p>
            <p>I am currently working on a puzzle platformer games in my spare time. You play as 
                Theo Jazzman, a horn player who was mysteriously magiced away to an abstract world of jazz and music.</p>
            <p>Theo Jazzman's Quest, as I am currently calling it, is a game that does not hold your hand. 
                the player must explore and interact with the world in order to progress through the game and unravel 
                the mysteries of the Jazziverse!</p>

            <p class="active">Next toys is a small toy manufacturing company located in Kowloon Bay, China. They tasked me 
                with creating a logo and brand identity for their company.
            </p>
            <p>Real Radical Flight is the brain-child of Jeffrey Loeb. His idea: create amazingly fun toys that teach 
                kids about aerodyamics. Real Radical Flight is NASA meets paper planes. Above is the design we decided upon.
             </p>
            <p>Unfortunately, KitCo Tires is not a real company. Instead, it is a tiny one-inch sticker designed as part of a set
                of sponsorship decals for an RC car called Redneck Roadkill by Eclipse Toys. This logo was my favorite out of 
                the bunch. You can find this and many other cool items created by yours truely inside the Redneck Roadkill box.  
            </p>
            <p>Debbie Dawson is an amazing hairstylist however, she lacked an eye-catching brand identity that matched 
                her skill. This logo above was our solution. Intended for business cards, letter head and the like. This logo 
                was also printed as a large vinyl sticker to be shown on the front window of her salon!</p>
