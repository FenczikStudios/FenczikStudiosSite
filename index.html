            <p class="active">The Guitarbacus is an innovative new Guitar learning application 
                I am developing for web and mobile devices. The Guitarbacus acts as a skeleton key
                for the guitar and it's an idea that is very close to my heart.
                I have always dreamed of creating a simple tool that allows musicians to learn the guitar, music theory
                and improvisation in a new intuitive way. The Guitarbacus is designed to maximize creativity.
                And I truely believe it does just that!
                <br><br> Click on to learn more!</p>
            <p>Comprehensive guides and tools accompany the Guitarbacus app to heighten the learning experience.
                At the click of a button the user will be able to access guides filled with chords and music theory
                to expand your ideas of what you can do with the Guitarbacus. Click the sound button
                to play any note on the guitarbacus and provide audio confirmation for every new concept. The Guitarbacus website
                will also be a vital component to the overall Guitarbacus experience. Utilize forums to engage with the 
                Guitarbacus community. Share new musical discoveries or ask the experts for help!
                <br><br>This project is still in development, sign up for the Fenczik Studios
                email-list to get progress updates for The Guitarbacus App!</p>
            <p>I am currently working on a puzzle platformer games in my spare time. You play as 
                Theo Jazzman, a horn player who was mysteriously magiced away to an abstract world of jazz and music.</p>
            <p>Theo Jazzman's Quest, as I am currently calling it, is a game that does not hold your hand. 
                the player must explore and interact with the world in order to progress through the game and unravel 
                the mysteries of the Jazziverse!</p>

            <p class="active">Next toys is a small toy manufacturing company located in Kowloon Bay, China. They tasked me 
                with creating a logo and brand identity for their company.
            </p>
            <p>Real Radical Flight is the brain-child of Jeffrey Loeb. His idea: create amazingly fun toys that teach 
                kids about aerodyamics. Real Radical Flight is NASA meets paper planes. Above is the design we decided upon.
             </p>
            <p>Unfortunately, KitCo Tires is not a real company. Instead, it is a tiny one-inch sticker designed as part of a set
                of sponsorship decals for an RC car called Redneck Roadkill by Eclipse Toys. This logo was my favorite out of 
                the bunch. You can find this and many other cool items created by yours truely inside the Redneck Roadkill box.  
            </p>
            <p>Debbie Dawson is an amazing hairstylist however, she lacked an eye-catching brand identity that matched 
                her skill. This logo above was our solution. Intended for business cards, letter head and the like. This logo 
                was also printed as a large vinyl sticker to be shown on the front window of her salon!</p>
