                Oakview Mechanical is a local HVAC company based in Colorado Springs. 
                They tasked me with creating an iconic mascot for their brand and a commercial
                that true stands out from the crowd. The result was a hand-drawn traditional animation 
                animated in photoshop and composited in after effects. The Backgrounds were created in Blender 
                to provide extra speed, quality and continuity to the project. This commercial was a joy to make.

                Tectum Roofing is a local Roofing Company in Colorado Springs. Tectum already has a bold and exciting

                bringing their mascot into THE THIRD DIMENSION! Using, blender ray tracing and PBR(physically based 
                rendering) materials I was able to create amazing, striking visuals in a short time! After I built, 
                the character I textured him and added materials. Then I placed him into the scenes and created the lighting.
                After the look of the commercial was fleshed out, I rigged and animatged the character. All post-processing, like the 
                holograms were created in blender then composited using after effects

            <p>This character i made to be a player character in the same sci-fi action beat-em-up as Shotgun Hippo.
                He is a bit more generic at first glance however, this character was made to show off Spine2d's awesome 
                skins feature. Using one set of skeletal animation data. Spine2d allows me to create as many costumes as I
                want for this character which is great because this game is all about <br> showing off your style!

                for the guitar and it's an idea that is very close to my heart.
                I have always dreamed of creating a simple tool that allows musicians to learn the guitar, music theory
                and improvisation in a new intuitive way. The Guitarbacus is designed to maximize creativity.
                And I truely believe it does just that!
            <br><br> Click on to learn more!</p>
            <p>Comprehensive guides and tools accompany the Guitarbacus app to heighten the learning experience.
                At the click of a button the user will be able to access guides filled with chords and music theory
                to expand your ideas of what you can do with the Guitaracus. Click the sound button
                to play any note on the guitarbacus to providing audio confirmation for every new concept. The Guitarbacus website
                will also be a vital component to the overall Guitarbacus experience. Utilize forums to engage with the 
                Guitarbacus community. Share new musical discoveries or ask the experts for help!

            <p class="active">For years I used tools like wix to create my portfolio site. Those tools are 
                great, but I was always left wanting greater control. This was one of the reasons why I decided to 
                start my coding journey. A few months, a few JavaScript courses, a lot of tutorials, and a few
                thousand lines of code later I have this awesome interactive site to show for it!

            <p> Above is just a brief snapshot of me making this website. This is just a sample of the code. If you are truely 
                curious, feel free to press f12 and peruse the code all you like!
            </p>
            <p>I thought it might be interesting to highlight my early process. For every project, whether its coding, 
                design, or animation I always have my trusty sketchbook at my side. It is important to makes wire-frames
                of a website to start the creative process. Making a website can be a daunting task but getting your ideas down
                on paper. After a few sketches, the entire project begins to take shape.

            <p>Unfortunately, KitCo Tires is not a real company. Instead, it is a tiny one-inch sticker designed as part of a set
                of sponsorship decals for an RC car called Redneck Roadkill by Eclipse Toys. This logo was my favorite out of 
                the bunch. You can find this and many other cool items created by yours truely inside the Redneck Roadkill box.

            <p>Debbie Dawson is an amazing hairstylist however, she lacked an eye-catching brand identity that matched 
                her skill. This logo above was our solution. Intended for business cards, letter head and the like. This logo 
                was also printed as a large vinyl sticker to be shown on the front window of her salon!</p>

                into illustrator to create the precise die-cut lines.
